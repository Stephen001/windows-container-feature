Contributing
============
To contribute to this repository, there are a few things you can do:
 - File bug reports.
 - Make enhacement requests.
 - Provide code contributions.

Bug Reports
-----------
To file a bug report, simply create a new issue using our 'Bug report' template. As ansible on Windows allows a number of different connection protocols and execution environments, it is useful to provide details about the kind of environment you are executing under. If it is possible for you to do so, please provide verbose ansible logs for the execution of this role that failed.

Enhancement Requests
--------------------
To make a request for enhancements, simply create a new issue using our 'Enhacement request' template. Where possible, try to describe the kind of real world scenarios where you believe the enhancement will be useful. This helps motivate other contributors to fulfill your request!

Code Contributions
------------------
To make a code contribution, please fork this repository then create a pull request. If your code contribution relates to an existing issue, please reference it in the pull request description. If the change is sufficiently small, you can skip having a separate issue to describe it. In general, we prefer issues to describe larger changes, so that we can help you make your contributions as effective as possible.

Code reviewers will look to test your changes prior to approving your pull request. To help this process, please ensure your pull request describes any specific environments that would be needed to effectively test with.

As the Windows community for ansible is quite small, code reviewers will attempt to make efforts to test and release your contributions promptly, to allow you to take full advantage of them as quickly as possible.
